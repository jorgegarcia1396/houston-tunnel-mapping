# Houston Tunnel Mapping System

## Objective

This project is an effort to create a Web or QGIS application which allows users to browse and search on points of interest (i.e. restaurants, businesses, etc.) in the Houston Tunnel System.  The application should allow users to get a route from one point to another.  Alternatively, the routing feature could optimize route for multiple desired stops (i.e. haircut, lunch, and dry cleaning).

NOTE: It looks like it may require a token, so you probably have to open the app first and grab the token from Network console in Edge or Chrome.

## Additional City of Houston GIS data

The following are some other sites for downloading GIS data which may also be incorporated into the application.
